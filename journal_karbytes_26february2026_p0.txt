"We make time for the things that matter most to us," is a 'positive affirmation' statement I spontaneously generated today while in 'dead space' (i.e. engaging in a thought experiment in which I role-play that 'I' (the role of 'living human') am dead (and have been dead for at least a few years alresdy) and that what I (the role-player) am doing is either inhabiting a ghostly conscious presence (with its own thoughts and perceptual 'frame of reference') or else some transient generalist utility/background human character. I also tend to the word 'we' in place of 'I' when I generate 'positive affirmations' or when I talk to myself (internally or out loud) because I see myself as being a composite of multiple (e.g. three) distinct nodes within a single intrapersonal communications network.
